"What I learned about SEO and analytics"

SEO prioritizes text in heading tags over other content so it is important to use meaningful headings and avoid vague text like "Welcome" or "Learn more". Headings should be keywords that users will search. I actually have to teach content standards just like this to my staff that help manage our company's websites (Seattle Public Schools). It is a very common mistake among our staff to use headings that are not SEO-friendly. It definitely makes me appreciate a high quality website more because I know how much work goes into keeping it clean.

I also learned that it is better to rely on organic search traffic rather than paid ads. One of the most useful website monitoring tools I have used in my own work is called SiteImprove. It has analytics, quality assurance, and behavior/heat maps. I am also able to set my own policies (rules) and if any pages are breaking those rules, SiteImprove will flag them for me.

"How I would implement SEO"

I would add the google analytics script to my website and run regular analytics reports to see where we are getting the most web traffic. I would make sure those pages especially are well-maintained, meaning content is up-to-date, headings are correct with only one H1 and proper hierarchy throughout the page. I would also ensure links are not broken and I am only linking to other high quality websites.

Ideally, down the road my site would have its own search function so I could look at the analytics and see what the most searched terms are. I would also run a few user experience focus groups and ask the users how they typically use websites with similar function to mine, like IMDb.com for example. Then I could use that to feedback to add appropriate copy, keywords, metadata, and headings to my site that would attract users.
